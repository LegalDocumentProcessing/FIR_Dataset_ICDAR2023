First Information Report (FIR) documents contain details about incidents of cognisable offence, that are written at police stations based on a complaint.
FIRs are usually filed by a police official filling up a printed form; hence the documents contain both printed and handwritten text. This Dataset consists of FIR documents written at police stations in India.
